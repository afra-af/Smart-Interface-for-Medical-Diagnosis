# Smart-Interface-for-Medical-Diagnosis
                                                         ABOUT
           
					Due to poor diet, alcohol consumption, stress, and other factors, health is something that is really neglected. The importance of healthcare cannot be overstated for a happy existence. But getting a doctor's appointment for any health issue is quite challenging. Internet addiction is more common today, but people are less likely to worry about their own health. They avoid going to the hospital for minor issues that could develop into serious illnesses in the future. Instead of searching through a list of potentially relevant documents on the web, creating question-and-answer forums is increasingly becoming a straightforward method of responding to those inquiries. Users must directly travel to the hospital for a check-up for minor issues, which takes additional time. 
             This project's goal is to concentrate on the idea of a text-to-text diagnosis interface that converses with patients about their medical problems and offers a tailored diagnosis based on their symptoms. People will therefore be aware of their health and be properly protected.
